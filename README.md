# Calculator
## Explanation
 -  .I am using the dragon board external keyboard and 7-segment LED to do this. We are using oscilloscopes to confirm that our PWM signal frequency and duty cycle can be altered and manipulated to match the percentages given to us. In this case, the percentages were 80% for our PWM signal and based on our button values, A, B, C and D, we needed to change the duty cycle percentage between the numbers of 20% and 80%, respectively. A = 20%, B= 40%, C= 60% and D = 80%. After completion of this, we are using the servo motor to attempt to achieve a 500 Hz output.
